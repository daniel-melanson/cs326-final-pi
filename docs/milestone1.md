- Initial wire frame called for a collapsable filter menu one one side. Tiles in the center, and a multi use menu on the far right. You would change view from list to calendar in a header icon not shows.
- Filter would include a searchable building, then room option. Duration and capactity would be sliders.
- Reservation modal would show at the same level as other containers.
### Final Product

- Build on Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/k2q8tJPOWVCbH2MGZYWcVa/Campus-Meet-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1

- Filter options moved from a side menu to below the header. Dropdowns for building and room will include a checkbox for prior search's and search feature to add additional rooms. Everything else will be check boxes over potential options to filter the "view". 
- Avaiability refers to if the filter shows events, exams, or empty spaces. 
- View refers to the sketched "tile view" or a unshown "calendar" view.
